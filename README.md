# Dubai_RealEstate_PricePrediction_Using_MLandDL

Dubai’s rapid urbanization, luxury-driven infrastructure, and status as a global investment hub 
have positioned its real estate market as one of the most dynamic and competitive in the world. 
Accurate real estate price prediction in Dubai is essential due to the market’s volatility, high
value transactions, and the diverse factors influencing property prices—including location, 
property type, developer reputation, and global economic conditions. Price prediction helps 
investors, brokers, developers, and policymakers make informed decisions, minimize financial 
risk, and identify profitable opportunities in a market driven by both local and international 
demand. However, predicting real estate prices in Dubai presents several challenges: the 
heterogeneity of properties, fluctuations due to economic cycles, regulatory changes, and 
limited availability of clean, structured data. To address these complexities, this study applies 
a wide range of machine learning and deep learning models that are well-suited for capturing 
non-linear relationships and learning from high-dimensional datasets. We evaluate the 
predictive performance of machine learning models such as Support Vector Regression (SVR), 
Random Forest (RF), Gradient Boosting Regression (GBR), Extreme Gradient Boosting 
(XGBoost), Ridge, and Lasso. These are selected for their strong baseline performance, 
interpretability, and robustness against overfitting. In parallel, advanced deep learning 
models—such as Deep & Cross Networks (DCN), Transformer, TabTransformer, Feature 
Token Transformer (FT-Transformer), and Gated Recurrent Units (GRU)—are used to explore 
their ability to learn deep feature interactions and temporal dynamics from complex datasets. 
Evaluation metrics including Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), 
and R-squared (R²) are used to assess model accuracy and generalization. This comparative 
analysis aims to identify the most effective modelling techniques to enhance price prediction 
in Dubai’s evolving real estate landscape.
